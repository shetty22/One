                    <p>
                        I’m a local resident of the Bay Area Peninsula for the past 16 years.
                        I have a background in Engineering in Information Science and Technology. I’m currently employed as an Asst. Construction Manager, for a General Contractor in San Francisco. I’ve had my real estate license for the past three years now. I started this new venture with Michelle Green, in August, 2019 and we have successfully closed a few deals ever since. Additionally, I have a large background in working with construction, which may be a helpful asset.
                        My passion for real estate started and continued to grow when I would visit open houses over the weekends. Whether it be  listing or helping a client buy a property, I enjoy interacting with people and helping others find their dream home. Working with the client, gathering their requirements, and providing them your knowledgeable input would allow for both parties to not only fulfill their wishes, but exceed it as well. Additionally, searching, listing and working in a property and working with the other staff members and companies allows for me to use my personal skills of responsibility, organization, and cooperation to get the job done in an efficient yet skillful manner.
