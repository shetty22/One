                    We (wife and I) decided, out of the blue, that Dec was the was right time to buy a house, after having lived in the country for not more than 18 months and with not much of a credit history.
                    Enter scene Vidya and Michelle. Vidya was an acquaintance before we decided to buy the house. Little did we know they both would end up as good buddies by the end of our home buying process.
                    Until we met them, my idea of realtors was “this is an easy job, shouldn’t be too hard to find and show homes to prospective buyer/sellers". Boy oh Boy, Was a mistaken!!
                    Vidya and Michelle walked us through the complete process and were extremely honest and transparent about the process. That's when I was made aware of the kind of effort, time and energy that goes in this job.
                    Being first time home buyers, we were filled with paranoia and had a lot of questions. They both patiently answered all our questions, putting us at ease, without which I probably wouldn't have been able to sleep. If they didn’t know something they were frank about it, and always got back to us with the right information. They also connected us with the mortgage bankers and worked seamlessly with the title company. Of course, like all big events in our lives, everything doesn't happen as per plan but these 2 ladies made sure that the issues were resolved and we were back on track.

                    Long story short - Team of Vidya and Michelle are transparent, honest, good negotiators and above all they are empathetic which i think is an absolute requirement especially when dealing with first time home buyers.

                        From the initial evaluation, to the advice we received on getting our work-in-progress ready for a quick sale, the service was outstanding, and ranged from 'must-do' tasks to 'suggestions', realistic timescales and helpful recommendations.  They were readily available whenever we needed information and always, always, in a professional friendly manner.  I know that I would not use anyone else. We have now completed the sale and are delighted with the service we received from Michelle and Vidya.  Thank you. You truly are WONDERFUL. (And I don't say that lightly!).

                    "They keep the Client's Best Interest in sharp focus" <br />
                    My husband and I had a dream of buying our first home, a small condo in Fremont closer to the best School district and easy access to Bart & Freeway. Vidya and Michelle helped to make that dream a reality. They  joined us to visit all open houses as we cannot go alone without an agent during the pandemic time. Though we felt bad, they always encouraged us to pick the home which we really feel like "OUR HOME" and not to hurry with our decision. The entire process went smoothly, and we just closed on an ideal new place we're excited to call home. They travelled this small journey of house purchasing with us and went an extra mile with customer service, too

                    Michelle and Vidya were an absolute pleasure to work with.  They were efficient, reliable, and always responded in a timely manner to whatever questions I had.  We were able to find my perfect home in Burlingame, which I know wouldn't have happened without them!  Highly recommend this duo!
